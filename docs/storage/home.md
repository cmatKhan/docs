Each HTCF user account has a 20GB home directory. This directory can be used to store scripts, development tools, etc. Home directories are located in */home/WUSTLKEY_NAME*" and are available on all nodes. They are kept on fault-tolerant storage and frequent snapshops are taken to prevent accidental data loss. Copies of the latest daily snapshots are kept offsite for disaster recovery purposes.
