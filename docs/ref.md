# Reference Storage (/ref)

Each lab or group with accounts on the HTCF is given reference space in which to store [software](#software) and/or [reference data](#data).

/ref is available from any node in the HTCF.  While there is no automated cleaning of files in /ref, *there is no guaranteed backup of data in /ref*.  **Any data in /ref that cannot be recreated should be copied to long term storage (LTS) for safe-keeping.**
